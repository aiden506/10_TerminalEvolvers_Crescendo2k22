Our Problem Statement:-
Vehicle Routing and Optimisation:-

Participants have to create a tool which can generate and communicate optimal routing plans to help reduce costs and environmental impact. 

Minimise transportation costs by optimising the route of vehicles from a single source to multiple destinations.
 Generate savings by determining the lowest-cost carrier and route for every shipment, for every mode, all across the globe. 
A “Green Score” to help track carbon footprint and sustainability. 

By efficient carrier planning using the shortest routes and cheaper modes of transport, there is an eventual saving on fuel and hence cost saving and better green score. 

The solution can build visibility on the expected time of arrival (ETA) with vehicle tracking including the impact of seasonality on the transportation. 

Analytics with visuals, dashboards and maps to track and trace vehicles
